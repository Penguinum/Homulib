What is it?
-----------
Library that contains audio-related algorithms. Firstly I've created this library for developing VST plugins, but now I'm also planning to use it for procedural sound in games.
Homulib is written in C++, but it contains C binding and can be compiled as a shared library (tested on Linux and Windows). Code is full of bugs, number of useful algorithms are tiny, but I'll improve it. Also, your help is welcome.

How to use this library?
------------------------
It's easy to use. Take a look at the example.cpp.

Why \*Homu\*?
-------------
Homura.
